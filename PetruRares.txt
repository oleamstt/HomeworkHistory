Petru Rareș (pronounced [ˈpetru ˈrareʃ]), sometimes known as Peter IV (Petru IV; ca. 1487 – 3 September 1546) was twice voievod of Moldavia: 20 January 1527 to 18 September 1538 and 19 
February 1541 to 3 September 1546. He was an illegitimate child born (probably at Hârlău) to Stephen the Great. His mother was Maria Răreșoaia of Hârlău, whose existence is not 
historically documented but who is said to have been the wife of a wealthy boyar fish-merchant nicknamed Rareș "rare-haired" (i.e., bald). Rareș thus was not Petru’s actual name but a 
nickname of his mother’s husband.

In his youth he was a fish merchant, but Prince Ștefăniță, grandson of Ștefan cel Mare, on his deathbed, recommended Petru as a suitable contender to the throne, thus acknowledging 
Petru's blood lineage from Ștefan cel Mare.
